Uncle Bob has <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1513641219376795662">followed up with me</a> to inform me that I may need his publisher's permission to keep this site up.

I've written to them and will bring the site back up if permission is granted ðŸ¤ž

If permission is not granted then perhaps there is an opportunity to create a new website that allows people to easily create their own custom sets of linkable code rules. If this interests you please leave your thoughts on <a href="https://forms.gle/S8RJ56Bm1A89sLzq6">this Google Form</a>.
