    This is a linkable reference of code smells & heuristics for better code reviews, inspired by the chapter of the
    same name in Bob Martin's "Clean Code".

    <summary>For those who are interested, there is a brief history of the site and how it came to be.</summary>
    <p>Like many I was inspired to be a better software engineer after reading Clean Code and found myself wanting to
        reference certain smells & heuristics in code reviews rather than explaining them all the time.</p>

    <p>So I asked Bob's permission on Twitter and <a
            href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1086256734094520320">he obliged</a>!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately some time later Bob realised I might need permission from his publisher and <a
            href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1513641219376795662">followed up with me</a>, which was fair
        enough</p>
    <p>Over the next few years I exchanged emails with the publisher (turns out we are very slow at replying to one
        another) and eventually they went silent so I decided we should just community-source our own smells &
        heuristics instead!</p>
